# Go Functions

## ðŸ“˜ Description
The Go-Functions repository provides a detailed exploration of functions in the Go programming language. This repository is perfect for developers looking to understand Go's function mechanisms through practical examples and well-structured code snippets.

Key topics covered:

- Basic Functions: Learn how to define and use functions in Go.
- Variadic Functions: Understand how to handle functions with a variable number of arguments.
- First-Class Functions: Explore Goâ€™s ability to treat functions as first-class citizens.
- Closures: Learn how to create and use closures effectively.
- Recursion: Understand recursive functions and their use cases.
- Defer: Master the defer statement for executing code at the end of function execution.
- Pointers in Functions: Learn how functions interact with pointers in Go.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
The project is organized into multiple sections to facilitate easy navigation and learning.

### **Main Files**
### Basic Functions/
This folder contains examples of Goâ€™s function syntax and fundamental usage:

- basicas.go: Demonstrates the basics of function definition and invocation.
- retornonomeado.go: Shows how to use named return values in Go.

### Advanced Functions/
This section covers more advanced function concepts:

- variatica.go: Example of variadic functions that accept a variable number of arguments.
- variaticaslice.go: Using slices with variadic functions.
- primeiraclasse.go: Demonstrates functions as first-class citizens in Go.
- closure.go: Illustrates the concept of closures and lexical scoping.
- comoparametro.go: Passing functions as parameters for flexible execution.

### Recursion/
This folder contains examples of recursive functions:

- recursividade1.go: Basic recursion example.
- recursividade2.go: More complex recursive function implementation.

### Special Features/
This section highlights unique function behaviors in Go:

- defer.go: Using defer for executing statements at the end of function execution.
- pilha.go: Understanding function call stacks and their impact.
- ponteiro.go: Exploring how functions interact with pointers.

### Initialization/
This section covers function execution at package initialization:

- init1.go: Demonstrates Goâ€™s init function for automatic execution.
- init2.go: Further examples of init functions in action.
